# Assigment_1
I created an app that addresses the following problems:

- The application adds students to the system through Class Student. I have declare a variable called count of the static type. This variable increases in each process of creating a new student. It counts the number of students who have been added and I take advantage of it to give values to the Student_ID, thus preventing repetition and the variable of I have a final type to prevent the possibility of modifying it from the user and I have defined the necessary variables such as the name, the date of birth, and the main function like constructor, the gitter, the sitter, and Function to_String to print the studentsâ€™ information.

- The another class is MasterStudent, this class inherit from student class ,create gitter and sitter and call super to call the constructor in the parent and I declare new variable especially the master class like research and supervisor and I make functions to submit research called submitResearch and another function to get supervisor ,I also declare enum contain major of BA_degree to give to master student 


- The another class MedicalStudent also inherit from student, I declare hospital and research as paramiter and the basic functions and override toString function.


- The another class EngineeringStudent, also inherit from Student class, contain main function.


- The another class OperationsInTheSystem,this class contain variable to attribution numbers of add, retrieve and remove.
operations made in system

- in the main class i make sum function to arranging and organizing the code like menu,cheakStudent and onother functions.
